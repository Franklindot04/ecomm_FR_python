# Ecommerce Microservice API

A learning-oriented ecommerce microservice built with FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, and Docker.

The project was developed incrementally through milestone-based stages, evolving from a simple MVP into a more realistic ecommerce backend while keeping the codebase clean, documented, testable, portable, and easy to extend.

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and adjust values as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Current configurable settings include:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `ALGORITHM`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`
- `APP_HOST`
- `APP_PORT`
- `REDIS_URL`
- `PRODUCT_CACHE_TTL`
- `RATE_LIMIT_TIMES`
- `RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS`

Notes:
- `.env.example` is committed as a safe template.
- `.env` remains local and should not be committed.
- Application settings are centralized in `app/config.py`.

---

## Running Tests

Run the full automated test suite with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Current baseline:
- 14 tests passing.
- Coverage includes authentication, products, cart, orders, payments, and background-task side effects.
- Tests run against an isolated SQLite test database using shared fixtures and FastAPI dependency overrides.
- Redis-dependent features are tested with an in-memory `FakeRedis` client.
- Background task flows are verified through generated invoice and notification artifacts.
- The test suite runs against the FastAPI app directly and does not require starting the server manually.
- Current known warning: `passlib` emits a Python `crypt` deprecation warning on Python 3.12+, but the suite still passes successfully.

---

## Running Migrations

Create or update the local database schema with:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Check the currently applied migration with:

```bash
alembic current
```

Current migration baseline:
- Initial schema migration: `6f5e3d5e8133`
- Payments migration: `14051421d3f0`
- Verified local database head: `14051421d3f0 (head)`
- Verified `payments` table present in SQLite after upgrade
- Stage 15 introduced no new schema changes

---

## Running with Docker

Build and start the containerized application with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Useful endpoints:
- `/docs`
- `/health`

Current Docker baseline:
- Containerized FastAPI app.
- Redis included as a Compose service.
- Environment variables loaded from `.env`.
- Redis service healthcheck enabled in Compose.
- API service waits on healthy Redis before startup.
- Container healthcheck enabled for API validation.
